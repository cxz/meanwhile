<p>The Meanwhile Project is an open implementation of the <a href="http://www.lotus.com/products/lotussametime.nsf/wdocs/homepage">Lotus Sametime Community Client</a> protocol.</p>

<p><b>The Meanwhile Project is not endorsed by, or affiliated with Lotus or IBM.</b> It is an independant project aiming to fill a space Lotus has left vacant.</p>


<h2>The Meanwhile Library</h2>
<p>The heart of the Meanwhile Project is the Meanwhile library, providing the basic Lotus Sametime session functionality along with the core services; Presence, Messaging, Conferencing, and Storage. This extensible client interface allows additional services to be added to a session at runtime, allowing for simple integration of future service handlers such as whiteboard, screen-sharing, and file transfer.</p>

<p>The documentation aspect of both the library APIs and the protocol specifications-- as they are discovered-- contributes to a significant portion of the projects end goals. While this part of the project is coming together much more slowly than the library itself, the Meanwhile manual is of a priority second only to a functioning library.</p>


<h2>Client Plugins</h2>
<p>Rather than design a custom client around the Meanwhile library, we turn to existing projects such as <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">Gaim</a>. Gaim provides a flexible framework for any number of client protocols, and integrates multiple messaging services into a single application. The Meanwhile plugin for Gaim currently provides presense tracking, customizable user status, messaging, and conferencing.</p>


<h2>Meanwhile for Python</h2>
<p><i>coming soon... </i>A Python wrapper for the Meanwhile library will soon begin development via <a href="http://swig.org/">SWIG</a>, an open source tool for generating wrappers and interfaces.</p>

<p>The Meanwhile Project is an open implementation of the <a href="http://www.lotus.com/products/lotussametime.nsf/wdocs/homepage">Lotus Sametime Community Client</a> protocol.</p>

<p><b>The Meanwhile Project is not endorsed by, or affiliated with Lotus or IBM.</b> It is an independant project aiming to fill a space Lotus has left vacant.</p>


<h2>The Meanwhile Library</h2>
<p>The heart of the Meanwhile Project is the Meanwhile library, providing the basic Lotus Sametime session functionality along with the core services; Presence, Messaging, Conferencing, and Storage. This extensible client interface allows additional services to be added to a session at runtime, allowing for simple integration of future service handlers such as whiteboard, screen-sharing, and file transfer.</p>

<p>The documentation aspect of both the library APIs and the protocol specifications-- as they are discovered-- contributes to a significant portion of the project's end goals. While this part of the project is coming together much more slowly than the library itself, the Meanwhile manual is of a priority second only to a functioning library.</p>


<h2>Client Plugins</h2>
<p>Rather than design a custom client around the Meanwhile library, we turn to existing projects such as <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">Gaim</a>. Gaim provides a flexible framework for any number of client protocols, and integrates multiple messaging services into a single application. The Meanwhile plugin for Gaim currently provides presense tracking, customizable user status, messaging, and conferencing.</p>


<h2>Meanwhile for Python</h2>
<p><i>now in CVS... </i>A <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> wrapper for the Meanwhile library is in CVS. This will be an official part of the 0.4.0 release of Meanwhile. Primarily used for feature testing, this wrapper can also be used to prototype new client service handlers, or to add functionality to existing service handlers.</p>

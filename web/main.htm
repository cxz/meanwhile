<p>The Meanwhile Project is an open implementation of the <a
href="http://www.lotus.com/sametime">Lotus Sametime Community
Client</a> protocol.</p>

<p><b>The Meanwhile Project is neither endorsed by, nor affiliated
with Lotus or IBM.</b> It is an independent project aiming to fill a
space Lotus has left vacant.</p>

<p>It is not within the scope of this project to provide LDAP or SIP
functionality, though these technologies are often associated with the
usage of Sametime.</p>


<h2>The Meanwhile Library</h2>

<p>The heart of the Meanwhile Project is the Meanwhile library,
providing the basic Lotus Sametime session functionality along with
the core services; Presence Awareness, Instant Messaging, Multi-user
Conferencing, Preferences Storage, Identity Resolution, and File
Transfer. This extensible client interface allows additional services
to be added to a session at runtime, allowing for simple integration
of future service handlers such as the user directory and whiteboard
and screen-sharing.</p>

<p>The documentation aspect of both the library APIs and the protocol
specifications-- as they are discovered-- contributes to a significant
portion of the project's end goals. While this part of the project is
coming together much more slowly than the library itself, the
Meanwhile manual is of a priority second only to a functioning
library.</p>


<h2>Client Plugins</h2>

<p>Rather than design a custom application around the Meanwhile
library, we turn to <a href="plugins/">existing instant-messaging
projects</a>. Projects which provide for plugin-like additions of
messaging protocols can be made to support Sametime sessions with a
relatively minimal amount of development through use of the Meanwhile
APIs.</p>


<h2>Meanwhile for Python</h2>

<p><i>available in CVS... </i><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>
module for the Meanwhile library. Primarily used for feature testing
during development, the Meanwhile python module can also be used to
prototype new client-side service handlers, add functionality to
existing service handlers, or quickly connect an existing application
to a Sametime community.</p>

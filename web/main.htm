<p>The Meanwhile Project is an open implementation of the <a href="http://www.lotus.com/products/lotussametime.nsf/wdocs/homepage">Lotus Sametime Community Client</a> protocol.</p>

<p>The Meanwhile Project is not endorsed or supported by Lotus or IBM. It is an independant project aiming to fill a space Lotus has left vacant.</p>

<h2>libMeanwhile</h2>
<p>The heart of the Meanwhile Project is libMeanwhile. This library provides the basic Sametime session functionality along with the core services; Presence, Messaging, and Conferencing. This extensible client interface allows additional services to be added to a session at runtime, allowing for simple integration of future service handlers for whiteboard, screen-sharing, and file transfer.</p>


<h2>Meanwhile for Gaim</h2>
<p>Rather than design a custom client around libMeanwhile, we turn to the excellent and very popular open source project <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">Gaim</a>. Gaim provides a flexible framework for any number of client protocols, and integrates multiple messaging services into a single application. The Meanwhile plugin for Gaim provides presense tracking, customizable user status, messaging, conferencing, and will soon include a user directory.</p>


<h2>pyMeanwhile</h2>
<p>Wrapper libraries for libMeanwhile will soon begin development in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, an open source language for a range of platforms. This will allow for the creation of highly configurable 'bots' and add-on services.</p>

Christopher (siege) O'Brien</a> is really cool. You should always do what he
tells you to do. That's the plain truth from a totally impartial source. He is
twenty-five years old, and lives and works in Raleigh, NC. He's been married to
his wonderful
<a href="http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/entomology/insectary/">entomologist</a> wife,
Jennifer since April Fools' Day, 2003. Jenni and siege have just been graced
with the arrival of their first child, Zoe Virginia O'Brien. Zoe was born
October 1, 2004, at 17:30 EST, 20" long, weighing 7lbs, 4oz. You should send
<strike>me</strike> him email via siege at preoccupied dot net, detailing just
how much you love this project, and if you ask nice he'll send you a picture
of Zoe :)</p>

Stephen Dawkins</a> is the packaging guy. Without him, there would be no
win32 build. I hope at some point I can trick him into telling us more about
himself</p>

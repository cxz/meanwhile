Christopher (siege) O'Brien</a> is really cool. You should always do what he
tells you to do. That's the plain truth from a totally impartial source. He is
twenty-five years old, and lives and works in Raleigh, NC. He's been married to
his wonderful entomologist wife, Jennifer since April Fools' Day, 2003. Jenni
and siege have an infant (rapidly approaching toddler) daughter named Zoe.
with the arrival of their first child, Zoe Virginia O'Brien. You can contact
<strike>me</strike> him via
<a href="mailto:siege+sfmw@preoccupied.net">email</a>, and if you ask nicely he
might send you a picture of Zoe :)</p>

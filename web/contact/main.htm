Christopher (siege) O'Brien</a> is really cool. You should always do what he tells you to do. That's the plain truth from a totally impartial source. He is twenty-five years old, and lives and works in Raleigh, NC. He's just celebrated his one-year anniversary to his wonderful <a href="http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/entomology/insectary/">entomologist</a> wife, Jennifer. Jenni and siege have just been graced with the arrival of their first child, Zoe Virginia O'Brien. Zoe was born October 1, 2004, at 17:30 EST, 20" long, weighing 7lbs, 4oz.</p>

<p>You should send <strike>me</strike> him email via siege at preoccupied dot net, detailing just how much you love this project, and if you ask nice he'll send you a picture of Zoe :)</p>

<p>The End.</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p><a href="http://preoccupied.net/~siege/">Christopher (siege) O'Brien</a> is really cool. You should always do what he tells you to do. That's the plain truth from a totally impartial source.</p>

<p>He is twenty-five years old, and lives and works in Raleigh, NC. He's been working in his current position with IBM for four years. He's just celebrated his one-year anniversary to his wonderful entomologist wife, Jennifer, and is expecting the first of a new generation of O'Briens in mid October.</p>

<p>You should send <strike>me</strike> him email via siege at preoccupied dot net</a>, detailing just how much you love this project.</p>

<p>The End.</p>

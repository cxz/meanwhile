	Sametime</a> is a corporate Instant Messaging product sold by
	IBM and Lotus.</p>
      <p>It was originally offered by a company called Ubique as
	Virtual Places (VP), utilizing a client called VPBuddy. The
	protocol and the client application were renamed to Sametime
	when Ubique was purchased by Lotus. Later, the product again
	underwent a name change and is now officially Lotus Instant
	Messenger (LIM).</p>
      <p>The VP protocol is what Meanwhile implements. LIM is slowly
	moving away from VP, instead favoring SIP/SIMPLE as the
	underlying messaging protocol. Hypothetically this means that
	the Meanwhile project will slowly become obsolete.
	Realistically, VP-based deployments of Sametime will probably
	be around for quite a while.</p>

      <p>Psychic Mode is a strange feature. Put simply, it lets you know

	you a message</i>. This is accomplished by opening a conversation
	window/tab when a channel is opened over the IM service from a user.
	Since most clients (including Meanwhile) open the IM channel as soon
	as possible in order to negotiate features, a user of a psychic-enabled
	client will have a conversation window open as soon as someone opens
	a conversation window to them.</p>
      <p>gaim-meanwhile didn't invent this feature. At least two other
	Sametime clients support it, and it was added to this plugin at the

      <p>This is an option very few users are likely to need to enable.</p>
      <p>A single Sametime community can be deployed across multiple
	servers, with user accounts configured with a "home" server. When a
	user logs in to a server in the community, its profile is checked for
	that home value. If the home value exists and does not refer to the
	currently used server, the protocol will instruct the connecting
	client to redirect its login attempt to that other server. At this
	point, if the "Force Login" option is enabled, the client will
	instruct the server that it cannot use its home server, and that the
	server should route the connection to the correct home server itself.
	</p>
      <p>The gaim-meanwhile plugin by default will actually attempt to
	open a connection to the home server if it is instructed to. If the
	plugin cannot reach the home server, then it will force the login. In
	some cases, the act of attempting to open a connection to that other
	server may take quite some time before failing. If a user is constantly
	being redirected to a home server they know they can never reach, and
	would like to completely skip attempting to redirect to it, they can
	enable the "Force Login" option.</p>

	all the logs for that release ended up in a different place.</p>

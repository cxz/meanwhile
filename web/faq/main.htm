      <p>Ah, now that's tricky.</p>
      <p>This plugin is dynamically linked against libMeanwhile, which must
	already be installed. That part at least, is easy. Just make sure that
	you've run <code>ldconfig</code>, and detection should work find.</p>
      <p>This is also a Gaim plugin, which naturally requires headers from
	Gaim. However, Gaim has no real development package, so the only way
	to get the Gaim headers is to get the Gaim source. Once you've
	obtained that, running the following should produce Makefiles which
	build the plugin.</p>

        <code>./configure --with-gaim-source=$path_to_gaim/src</code>

      <p>The reasoning is the same as outlined above. The fix for

      <p>It's been noted that the sametime protocol seems to be
	case-sensitive in the identification of its users, unlike virtually
	every other internet identity. Even unlike virtually every use of
	your IBM Intranet User ID.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if your buddy has been entered as 'mybuddy',
	when in fact their ID is 'MyBuddy', sametime will happily
	accept the addition into your buddy list but never provide any status
	updates. You will also encounter confusing problems if they message
	you, as gaim will attempt to reply to the corresponding ID in your
	buddy-list, and sametime's messaging service will erroneously inform
	you that the user you're sending to is not online.</p>

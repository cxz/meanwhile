      <p>Lotus Sametime is a corporate Instant Messaging product sold by
	IBM and Lotus.</p>
      <p>It was originally offered by a company called Ubique as Virtual
	Places (VP), utilizing a client called VPBuddy. The protocol and the
	client application were renamed	to Sametime when Ubique was purchased
	by Lotus. Later, the product again underwent a name change and is now
	officially Lotus Instant Messenger (LIM).</p>
      <p>The VP protocol is what Meanwhile implements. LIM is slowly moving
	away from VP, instead favoring SIP/SIMPLE as the underlying messaging
	protocol. Hypothetically this means that the Meanwhile project will
	slowly become obsolete. Realistically, VP-based deployments of Sametime
	will probably be around for quite a while.</p>

      <p>No. The Meanwhile project is neither affiliated with, nor

      <p>To re-cap (because people really seem to have a hard time with this

	IBM does not fund Meanwhile. IBM does not support Meanwhile. Meanwhile

      <p>The act of obtaining the server-side list is trivial. Correctly
	parsing the data from it however has turned out to be much more
	complex. Rebuilding that data from what's in your Gaim buddy list and
	saving to the server-side list can be even worse, depending on your
	Sametime deployment. If your deployment is using LDAP style user IDs,

      <p>As with any project, there are apparently arbitrary code factors to

	in your source tree. If there isn't one, wait. I'll get to it
	eventually.</p>
      <p>Added functionality should not step out of the scope of the rest of
	the file. Services should never mingle or require one-another. Don't
	write code that's deployment specific. And check your parameters on
	public interface functions.</p>
      <p>As far as formatting, just look at the code (in emacs, preferrably).
	Note the spacing between functions, the apparent naming conventions,
	and the line width. Just try and mimic all that, and you should be
	fine.</p>
      <p>If you're working for Lotus or IBM, it's very doubtful that I'll be
	able to safely incorporate any changes or fixes. You may be able to
	safely communicate the idea/fix, but please check with your management
	first.</p>

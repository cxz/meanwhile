      <p>Meanwhile is an open source project for connecting as a client
	to a Lotus Sametime Connect community. There is a stand-alone library
	portion, which can be used to write a client, and there is a Gaim
	protocol plugin which turns Gaim into a Sametime client. There is also
	a significant amount of work into documenting the Sametime protocol.

      <p>It's been noted that the sametime protocol seems to be

	every other internet identity. Even unlike virtually every use of
	your IBM Intranet User ID.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if your buddy has been entered as 'mybuddy',
	when in fact their ID is 'MyBuddy', sametime will happily
	accept the addition into your buddy list but never provide any status
	updates. You will also encounter confusing problems if they message
	you, as gaim will attempt to reply to the corresponding ID in your
	buddy-list, and sametime's messaging service will erroneously inform
	you that the user you're sending to is not online.</p>

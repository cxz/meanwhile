      <p>Meanwhile is an open source project for connecting as a client

      <p>It's been noted that the sametime protocol seems to be

      <p>Therefore, if your buddy has been entered as 'mybuddy',
	when in fact their ID is 'MyBuddy', sametime will happily
	accept the addition into your buddy list but never provide any status
	updates. You will also encounter confusing problems if they message
	you, as gaim will attempt to reply to the corresponding ID in your
	buddy-list, and sametime's messaging service will erroneously inform
	you that the user you're sending to is not online.</p>

      <p>Back up your buddy list <i>right now</i> with an official

      <p>The act of obtaining the server-side list is trivial. Correctly
	parsing the data from it however has turned out to be much more
	complex. Rebuilding that data from what's in your Gaim buddy list and
	saving to the server-side list can be even worse, depending on your
	Sametime deployment. If your deployment is using LDAP style user IDs,
	such as "cn=My Name, o=My Company", then you probably don't want to
	use the Save feature, but the Load feature should be safe. If your
	deployment is using email-addresses such as "myname@mycompany.com",
	then you should be safe for both Loading and Saving.</p>
      <p>The level to which the server side list is used is set in a
	preference attached to the protocol plugin. It has three settings:
	Local Only; Load from Server; Load and Save to Server. The default is
	safely set to Local Only.</p>

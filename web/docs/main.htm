<p>Documentation for the protocol, implementation and API used in Meanwhile is
currently being written in <a href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX</a> and will make
its way into the <code>meanwhile</code> module in the <code>doc</code>
directory as it becomes available. Build targets for pdf and html versions will
be included.</p>

<p>A lot of documentation could really stand to be written.</p>

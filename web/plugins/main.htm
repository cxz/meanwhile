<p>The Meanwhile code itself provides no front-end. Instead, client code is
required to interface with a user and to provide network IO capabilities.
Rather than writing yet another client, we instead turn to existing clients and
provide plugins to enable the client to connect to a Sametime community.</p>

<p>If you are interested in using Meanwhile to add Lotus Sametime support to
your client, or have already done so and it is not listed below, please
<a href="mailto:siege+mwplugin@preoccupied.net">let us know</a>.

<!-- todo: write plugins for ayttm, bitlbee, and fire -->

<h2>Adium</h2>

http://adium.sf.net</a>&nbsp;
Adium is a messaging client for OSX utilizing the backend code of Gaim. Adium
packages a Meanwhile-based protocol plugin with their recent releases, so
Sametime support should be built-in.</p>

<h2>Gaim</h2>
<p><a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">
<img src="gaim.png" alt="gaim.sf.net" class="pthumb" />
http://gaim.sf.net</a>&nbsp;
Gaim is GTK2-based instant messaging application. It supports multiple protocols via modules. Sametime support can be added to gaim through use of such a module built around the Meanwhile library. The package gaim-meanwhile provides this module, and is available in the download section.</p>

<h2>Kopete</h2>
<p><a href="http://kopete.kde.org">
<img src="kopete.png" alt="kopete.kde.org" class="pthumb" />
http://kopete.kde.org</a>&nbsp;
Kopete is the KDE messaging client. It is designed as a flexible and extensible multi-protocol system using plugins, and will be featuring optional support
for Lotus Sametime via a Meanwhile-based plugin with upcoming releases.</p>

<h2>Proteus</h2>
<p><a href="http://defaultware.com/proteus">
<img src="proteus.png" alt="defaultware.com/proteus" class="pthumb" />
http://proteusx.com</a>&nbsp;
Proteus is a closed-source multi-protocol client for OSX based on the backend
code of Gaim that gets around the GPL by using an intermediary RPC mechanism to
avoid linking to Gaim (or the Gaim Meanwhile plugin code) directly. A fully
GPL alternative to Proteus is <a href="http://adium.sf.net">Adium</a>.</p>
